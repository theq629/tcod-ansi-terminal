Welcome to tcod-ansi-terminal's documentation!
==============================================

Minimal true colour ANSI terminal support for Python TCOD (``tcod``).

This doesn't try to support everything or be very compatible, just to cover
basic functionality on common terminals with true colour support. Note that
TCOD itself `may eventually get terminal support
<https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/issues/78>`_, so check it before committing
to using this.

This is currently all in Python code and may not be very performant.

There is an example included in ``example/``. It also serves for basic testing
of features.
